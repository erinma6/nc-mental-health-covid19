This repository is part of the CX100 Carolina Across Data Hackathon, which our team won. We were awarded $500 for making the best infographic among 17 undergraduate teams and 8 graduate teams. 


## Objective of Infographic

The objective of our infographic was to analyze the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of individuals. Our analysis was primarily focused on looking at key factors that were resposible for the scale of the pandemic and ways we can mitigate a future mental health crisis.

We found our data online at the NC gov website.

## Results & Conclusions

We found out that the number of people being served in mental health center and psychiatric hospitals has significantly decreased in the past few years. This raised an important question that requires further investigation. 

We also realized that COVID was an important instigator that was the tipping point of the iceberg which led to mental health depreciation, physical health depreciation, excessive alcohol consumption, and even substance abuse which further aggraved the menatl health problems and forcing people into an inescapable feedback loop.
